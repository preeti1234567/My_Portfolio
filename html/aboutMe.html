            <p>Hey, this is my homepage, so I have to say something about myself. Sometimes it is hard to introduce yourself because you know yourself so well that
                you do not know where to start with.</p>  
            <p>Let me give a try to see what kind of image you have about me
                through my self-description. I am a mother of two kids. I like to cook different type food. There are many things. I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like
                to read, I like to think, I like to dream, I like to listen. I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the
                wind coming from the ocean.  I like the land and the nature, I like people.I like
                to laugh.</p>  
            <p>I always wanted to be a programmer . Earlier I used to be in an official job. But after kids, I prefer to be a full time mom. But now, as my kids are grown I want to enter again in this world of coding.  I am really admire those coders. Of course, I 
                am just someone who is right now learning coding in bootcamp. But my dream is still alive. May be! I don't have much experience but while doing the full time mom job I learned to manage many things and experienced many aspects of life which I think I can implement in this coding environment</p>
