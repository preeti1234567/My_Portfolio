      <p class="card-text">UDecide helps voters get to know their current federal representatives for the election cycle. We provide a "single pane of glass" for users to know who their four representatives are (President, two Senators, and House member).</p> <p>We display this information in a user friendly way using UI Semantic cards element.
        Once the user has been introduced to their representative, then we dynamically display a button to see what legislation they have sponsored (usually a good indicator of their priorities in office). We hope users can then use this information to decide if their values are being appropriately represented by their current federal official.</p> <p>If not, Nov 3, 2020 is the day to make your opinion matter!</p>
